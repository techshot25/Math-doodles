    "### Change the limits of integration to use Gauss-Legendre Quadrature formula for evaluating integrals.\n",
    "We will begin by attempting to convert a definite integral with finite bounds $a$ and $b$ to $-1$ and $1$:\n",

    "We can convert the limits of an integral by means of a scale and a shift. To convert the x-axis to another axis that is shifted and scaled to make the limits satisfy our needs. We can write a linear equation that maps $a$ to $-1$ and $b$ to $1$ as follows:\n",
    "$$x = m\\: t + c$$\n",
    "Plugging in the values for converting $a$ and $b$ to get:\n",
    "$$a = m\\:(-1)+c$$\n",

    "$$m = \\frac{b-a}{2} \\; \\text{and} \\; c = \\frac{b+a}{2}$$\n",
    "Therefore\n",
    "$$x = \\frac{b-a}{2}\\;t+ \\frac{b+1}{2}$$\n",
    "So finally we need to take the derivative to get:\n",
    "$$dx = \\frac{b-a}{2}\\;dt$$\n",
    "Back to our integral to get:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we have all the tools we need to write our program that converts the function with new bounds and evaluate using Gauss-Legendre Quadrature of 3 points.
